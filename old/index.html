								<h2>Code Development</h2>
								<p>I've been programming for a couple years now and have bounced between languages involved with web development to bash scripting. I've been loving C#, specifically as it applies to game creation in <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>. Most recently, I've been working with C++ to learn more about the techniques of object oriented programming.</p>

								<h2>Ultimate Frisbee</h2>
								<p>It's 2018 and this is my sixth year playing friz. Over the last couple years I've competed in multiple tournaments including the U.S. Open in Minnesota as well as Club Regional Championships. I love the sport, I love the people.</p>

								<h2>Music</h2>
								<p>From a young age, I grew up in a musical household. My parents both play various instruments as well as sing, and those skills have passed down to me. I play guitar and sing, and can carry a beat on drums and play simple chord songs on piano. Can't seem to forget how much of a wonder music is, and that is likely what brings me to listen to so many tunes. I've got pretty wide tastes, from alternative, to classic rock, to punk pop. Take a look at my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/elijahscherz">Spotify</a> to find some new bands and some great playlists.</p>

								<h2>BUT... did you know...?</h2>
								<p>Here are a couple more things about me. I've done some cool stuff and I've lived a pretty decent life so far.<br />
								However, there are always more things to be done. Maybe I should take up hip hop dancing..</p>

									<h3>Currently Attending The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</h3>
									<p>It's a great place, honestly.</p>

									<p>Also at Chelsea, I take great pride in showing the little ones how amazing God's love can really be. Jealous?</p>

									<h3>Blender</h3>
									<p>This <a href="https://www.blender.org/">3D modeling software</a> has to be one of the most fantastic things I've ever played with. With the resources online, I guarantee you can shock yourself at the realism you can make.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-video-camera">
									<h3>Raspberry Pi</h3>
									<p>I've started working with these little devices, and they can be applied in some of the most interesting ways. Recently, I made a system that combines arcade, SNES, NES, SEGA, and even more. It started as a small project inspired by wanting to let my dad play the games he used to play, but grew into a system with thousands of games, multiple controllers, and hopefully a portable version in the near future.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-film">
									<h3>Movies and TV</h3>
									<p>I'm a huge movie and TV fan. I've fancied myself a bit of a critic when it comes to these things, and I very much enjoy analyzing films and pulling them apart to see what either makes them good or garbage. Wonder Woman? Good. Stranger Things? Good. Suicide Squad? Not so good.</p>
