I built this site not too long ago after wanting to change it from my old one. I decided that I wanted to learn Angular and Typescript so took this site as an opportunity. I'm still learning a lot of the concepts, as it is a big framework, but I love the power of it. The Github Gists at the bottom of this page are fetched from a service that utilizes Angular's HTTPClient class and the Github API to pull the code and information of all my public gists. Pretty sweet!

I make use of CSS for animations and cool transitions, and have been using Font Awesome for icons (as they have a module for Angular now).
