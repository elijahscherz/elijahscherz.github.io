              I've been programming for a couple years now and have bounced
              between languages involved with web development to bash scripting.
              I've been loving C#, specifically as it applies to game creation
              in <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>. Most recently, I've
              been working with C++ to learn more about the techniques of object

            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              From a young age, I grew up in a musical household. My parents
              both play various instruments as well as sing, and those skills
              have passed down to me. I play guitar and sing, and can carry a
              beat on drums and play simple chord songs on piano. Can't seem to
              forget how much of a wonder music is, and that is likely what
              brings me to listen to so many tunes. I've got pretty wide tastes,
              from alternative, to classic rock, to punk pop. Take a look at my
              <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/elijahscherz">Spotify</a>
              to find some new bands and some great playlists.

            However, there are always more things to be done. Maybe I should

              I've started working with these little devices, and they can
              be applied in some of the most interesting ways. Recently, I
              made a system that combines arcade, SNES, NES, SEGA, and even
              more. It started as a small project inspired by wanting to let
              my dad play the games he used to play, but grew into a system
              with thousands of games, multiple controllers, and hopefully a
              portable version in the near future.

              analyzing films and pulling them apart to see what either
              makes them good or garbage. Wonder Woman? Good. Stranger
              Things? Good. Suicide Squad? Not so good.
